This is the official build for the Pixaful website.

I have it out in the open for everyone to see and learn from, and so I can learn from you!

It is based on underscores, so no child themes are hurt in the making of this website. For the final build I am also staying away from page builders and any plugins I consider to be heavy. I use ACF for many of my builds but as I am learning, I intend to design my own custom post types and gutenberg blocks.
